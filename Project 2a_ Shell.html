<h2>Important Dates and Other Stuff</h2> 

<p><b>Due:</b> Monday, 10/11 by midnight.</p> 

<p><b>This project is to be done by yourself.</b> </p> 

<p><b>Tests:</b> Tests will be made available shortly.</p> 

<h2>Questions?</h2> 

<p>Send questions using piazza or use office hours. If the question is about
your code, copy all of of your code into your handin directory (details below)
and include your login in your email (you are free to modify the contents of
your handin directory prior to the due date). Do <b>not</b> put code snippets
into piazza (unless they are very short). Also include all other relevant
information, such as cutting and pasting what you typed and the results from
the screen. In general, the more information you give, the more we can help.</p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>The basic project description is found
<a href=https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/processes-shell>here.</a> 
Please read this carefully in order to understand exactly what to do.</p> 

<p>This project is to be done on the lab machines (listed
<a href=https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2012-08-16-instructional-facilities/>
here</a> ), so you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based
platform (Linux).</p> 

<h2>Differences</h2> 

<p>There are some modifications to that basic description above. They are:
<ul>
<li>There is no need to do <b>parallel commands.</b> However, you can if you like; it's not too bad, really.</li> 
<li>There is a special built-in command you need to add, which is called <b>loop.</b> When the user types:
<pre>
prompt> loop 10 somecommand
</pre> 
the wish shell should run <code>somecommand</code> ten times.
</li> 
For example, if the user types <code>echo hello</code> as the command (to run the program <code>/bin/echo</code> , which just
prints out whatever the arguments to it are), the shell should do this:
<pre>
prompt> loop 5 echo hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
prompt>
</pre> 
To make this slightly more useful, there is one more feature you'll need to add, a loop variable.
This variable is referred to by <code>$loop</code> . Thus, the user should then be able to do type:
<pre>
prompt> loop 5 echo hello $loop
hello 1
hello 2
hello 3
hello 4
hello 5
prompt>
</pre> 
</ul> 
</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p><b>Before beginning:</b> If you don't remember much about the Unix/C
environment, read
<a href=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-tutorial.pdf>this tutorial.</a> 
It has some useful tips for programming.</p> 

<p><b>This project should be done alone.</b> Copying code (from others) is
considered cheating. Read <a href=../dontcheat.html>this</a> for more info on
what is OK and what is not. Please help us all have a good semester by not
doing this.</p> 

<h2>Contest</h2> 

<p>There will be a contest for the <b>smallest</b> shell store. It will be announced soon
(and the due date for the contest will be later than the turned-in version for
credit). Whoever writes the code that is the the smallest shell will win fame, glory,
and an amazing 537 prize! But mostly glory.</p> 


<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>You should turn in one file, <code>wish.c</code> , which we will compile and test.</p> 

<p>The handin directory is <code>~cs537-1/handin/login/p2a</code> where <code>login</code> is
your login. For example, Remzi's login is <code>remzi</code> , and thus he would copy
his beautiful code into <code>~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p2a</code> . Copying of
these files is accomplished with the <code>cp</code> program, as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
prompt> cp wish.c ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p2a/
</pre> </blockquote> </p> 

<p>When done, type <code>ls ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p2a</code> to see that all the
files are in place correctly.</p> 

<p>Finally, in your p2a directory, please include a README file. In there,
describe what you did a little bit. There is no particular requirement for the
length of the README; just get in the habit of writing a little bit about what
you did, so that another human could understand it.</p>
