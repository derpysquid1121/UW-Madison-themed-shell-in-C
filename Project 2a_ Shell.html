Project 2a: Shell (Linux)

This project is to be done by yourself.

Overview

The basic project description is found
https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/processes-shell 
Please read this carefully in order to understand exactly what to do.

Differences

There are some modifications to that basic description above. They are:
There is no need to do parallel commands. However, you can if you like; it's not too bad, really.
There is a special built-in command you need to add, which is called loop. When the user types:
prompt> loop 10 somecommand
the wish shell should run somecommand ten times.
For example, if the user types echo hello as the command (to run the program /bin/echo , which just
prints out whatever the arguments to it are), the shell should do this:

prompt> loop 5 echo hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
prompt>

To make this slightly more useful, there is one more feature you'll need to add, a loop variable.
This variable is referred to by $loop. Thus, the user should then be able to do type:

prompt> loop 5 echo hello $loop
hello 1
hello 2
hello 3
hello 4
hello 5
prompt>
